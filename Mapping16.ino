Scaffolding: Mapping - Group 16

Program by: Luke Whipple and Fabiana Rodriguez Velez

GOAL:
Bop-It like game where the player must flick the Circuit Playground in different directions,
cover the device with their hand, or shout into it depending on different Neopixel patterns.
Upon taking too long or making a mistake, the game will end and your score will be displayed.

TO PLAY:
Hold the device with one hand parralel to the ground and press the left button to start the game.

2-3 Neopixels will light in the direction you need to move the sensor,
so hold it firm when you move your arm in that direction.
If all the neopixels start flashing, you need to shout into the device.
If the neopixels start to alternate a dim glow, you need to cover the device with your other hand.

If you succeeded, a short animation will play along with a possitive beep.
If you did the wrong action or took too long, 
the neopixels will flash red with a long buzzer and the game ends. Your score is then displayed.

Your score is based on the number of LEDs that light up, ranging as so:
  0-5: RED
  6-10: ORANGE
  11-15: YELLOW
  16-20: GREEN
  21-25: BLUE
  26-30: INDIGO
  31-35: VIOLET
  36-40: WHITE
  41-45: RAINBOW
  (45 is the highest score)

To play again, just press the left button again. Scores are not tracked.
